## Event Handling

Vue leverages JavaScript’s built-in ability to listen to DOM events and makes it simple to respond to all types of user input. We can use the v-on directive to listen to DOM events and trigger a handler function. This is such a common task v-on has its very own short-hand, the @ symbol.

The handler function can be written inline, or you can define a method in your \<script setup> tag and pass it to v-on. Inline handlers are great for performing simple tasks, while method handlers are better suited to hold more complex logic. A method handler automatically receives the native DOM event object as an argument.

You can either bind a method directly, or you can call methods in an inline handler, allowing you to pass the method a dynamic argument. If you need to pass an argument to your bound method and also access the DOM event, you can pass it to your method using the special $event variable syntax.

Vue also gives you the ability to use event modifiers for common scenarios. By postfixing a modifier after the handler passed to v-on, you can shorten the amount of code needed in your method.

(example from code)

With the v-on directive, we can respond to every event that vanilla JavaScript can.

## Form Input Bindings

Vue makes it easy to wire up a two-way binding between our managed state and a form input element, with the help of the v-model directive.

A typical frontend value binding flow:

```javascript
<input
  :value="text"
  @input="event => text = event.target.value">
```

With Vue’s v-model:

```javascript
<input v-model="text">

```

V-model also accepts modifiers, similar to v-on. To convert a string to a number, you can add the number modifier, and .trim is also a handy modifier to remove additional whitespace from your user input:

```javascript
<input v-model.number="age" />
<input v-model.trim="msg" />
```
