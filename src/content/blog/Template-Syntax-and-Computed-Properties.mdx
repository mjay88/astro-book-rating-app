Vue allows you to bind an HTML-based scaffolding to the state declared in your \<script setup> tag. Vue then uses its core reactivity to only update and re-render the parts of your app it needs to when your state changes.

Binding data from your component instance to your UI is quite simple: using the double curly braces syntax, we can render any reactive state we have declared to the screen. Vue binding supports property keys as well as JavaScript expressions, including ternary expressions, mathematical evaluations, and the return value of any methods exposed in your component.
