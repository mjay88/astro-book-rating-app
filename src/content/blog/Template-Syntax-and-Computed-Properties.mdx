## Template Syntax

Vue allows you to bind an HTML-based scaffolding to the state declared in your \<script setup> tag. Vue then uses its core reactivity to only update and re-render the parts of your app it needs to when your state changes.

## Data Binding

Binding data from your component instance to your UI is quite simple: using the double curly braces syntax, we can render any reactive state we have declared to the screen. Vue binding supports property keys as well as JavaScript expressions, including ternary expressions, mathematical evaluations, and the return value of any methods exposed in your component.

```javascript
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Vue Template Syntax</h1>
  </header>
  <section id="app">
    <h2>Add A Message</h2>
    <input type="text" ref="userText" />
    <button @click="setText">Set Text</button>
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</section>
	</body >
```

## Directives

You can also bind data dynamically to HTML elements using the v-bind directive. Vue directives are attributes prefixed with `v-`. A directive helps Vue to dynamically update the DOM when the value or expression passed to it changes.  `v-if` is a directive commonly used to render an element conditionally.

```javascript
<p v-if='2 + 2 > 0'> Greater than zero</p>
```

If we had an expression that resulted in a falsy value, say 2 + 2 > 5, the element would not be included in the DOM.

Some directives accept an argument, passed by using a colon after the directive name. Here, the v-bind directive is used to update the source of an img element reactively:

```javascript
<img v-bind:src='imageSrc' />
```

Using `v-bind` tells Vue to keep the element’s src attribute in sync with the imageSrc property coming from your state. The short-hand syntax for v-bind is a little cleaner, and accepted as common usage:

```javascript
<img :src="imageSrc" />
```

`v-on` is another common directive and is used to handle dom events. Since `v-on` is so common, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax, the `@`symbol:

```javascript
const count = ref(0)
< button v-on:click="count--">Add 1</button>
<p>Count is: {{ count }}</p>
<button @click="count++">Add 1</button>
```

`v-for` is another directive used for rendering an element multiple times, typically used to render lists:

```javascript
<ul>
  <li v-for="item in array">{{ item.name }}</li>
</ul>

```

Pro tip: If the attribute has the same name as the value it is being bound to, the syntax can be shortened to omit the attribute value, much like shorthand notation for a plain JavaScript object literal.

```javascript
const book = {
  key: "1FGJLDNOL",
  title: "Animal Farm"
}
const { key } = book;
<div :key>{{book.title}}</div>
```

Attributes can also be bound to boolean values.

```javascript
const isButtonDisabled = ref(true)

< button :disabled="isButtonDisabled">Click Me</button>

```

You may also bind multiple attributes to an element simultaneously:

```javascript
const attributes = {
  id: bookId,
  isDisabled: true
}

<button v-bind="attribues">Click Me</button>
```
